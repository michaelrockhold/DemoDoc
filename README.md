DemoDoc

This small app project is demo code, providing an example of combining several features that I end up using together a lot:

 - document-based app
 - uses Core Data via NSPersistentDocument
 - main document window has a split view
 - sidebar of main window is outline view
 - outline view shares treeController with sibling views
 - has 'Import' item in File menu
 
You can think of this as a cleaned-up synthesis of the 'Document-based App' starter app straight out of the Xcode project wizard, combined with Apple's own 'Navigating Hierarchical Data Using Outline and Split Views' demo project.
